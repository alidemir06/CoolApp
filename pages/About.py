Hey there! I'm **Ali Demir**, a first-year mechanical engineering student who's super
excited about space, rockets, and AI. I'm still learning, but I'm really into using 
machine learning to solve cool problems. I made this website to share my projects and
stuff with you. I'm all about exploring new ideas and trying out new things, and I hope
you'll join me on this adventure!

I'm still figuring things out, but I'm always eager to learn more and grow. Stick around,
and let's discover some awesome stuff together!
